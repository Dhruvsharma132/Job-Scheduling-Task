# Job-Scheduling-Task
The project report contains a detailed 
comparative analysis of three major job scheduling algorithms 
namely LPP, Greedy Algorithm, and Genetic Algorithm. The 
research paper underlines the importance of the selected 
algorithm in order to optimize job scheduling with the aim of 
enhance operational efficiency thereof. All the three algorithms 
have been significant in different industries in order to fully 
optimize operational efficiency. The research paper evaluates 
the performance of these three algorithms under different 
numbers of jobs and draws a comparison by examining the key 
performance indicators included for comparison which are 
makespan, idle time, and wait time. The LPP is a method that 
has been found effective when the situation calls for a near
perfect solution in which the theoretical optimization exists in a 
relatively small and less dynamic environment. On the other 
hand, the Greedy Algorithm is better if the solution has to be 
delivered quickly with high throughput, and the weakness of the 
system is in long-term efficiency. It is the Genetic Algorithm that 
turns out to be most effective in more complex and highly 
dynamic situations, considering the flexibility and the tendency 
to often perform better in the makespan compared to LPP. The 
strategic recommendations are made on the basis of specific 
operational needs for the effective flow of operations in the 
improvement of productivity. This project report also makes use 
of visual aids such as line plot and box plot for comparing the 
performance of the chosen algorithms.
